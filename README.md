# border-games-rewrite
Crosser (2000) and La Migra (2001) rewritten in P5.JS and P5.Play.JS

This project rewrites two videogames created with the SWEAT Collaborative as works of art. The directory called "history" includes historical documentation. It is not exhaustive.

I've created this repository even though it has come to light that Microsoft and, by extension its subsidiary, gitHub is providing material support to ICE. I do not support ICE.
